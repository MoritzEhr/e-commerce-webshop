        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="main-text">
            <p>ProFans was started with a simple idea: to bring you great fans. Without all the noise, in every sense of
                the word.<br><br>
                Back in 2020, we noticed something missing. Most electronics stores sold fans, but they were just
                another product on the shelf: limited choices, questionable quality, and not much real advice. So, we
                set
                out to do things differently.<br><br>
                At ProFans, fans are our thing. That's all we do, and we do it well. By focusing only on fans, we can
                offer a handpicked selection, real expertise, and support that actually helps.<br><br>
                We serve both homes and businesses. In fact we serve anyone who cares about comfort, efficiency, and
                products that last.
                Whether you need a super-quiet desk fan for your office or a powerful ceiling fan for a big space, we
                make it easy to find the right one and get it to you fast.<br><br>
                Our team is made up of engineers, customer service pros, and logistics experts, all working toward one
                goal: making your air better, the easy way.<br><br>
                <i>We don't just sell fans. We stand behind them.</i>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header">Mission & Values</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">At ProFans, we think comfort should be simple.<br><br>
                    Our mission is to make climate control easy, effective and accessible without cutting corners on
                    quality, design or support. We focus on fans because we believe in doing one thing really
                    well.<br><br>
                    Here's what matters to us:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliability – We only stock products we trust to last.</li>
                        <li>Clarity – No confusing talk or pushy sales, just honest advice.</li>
                        <li>Customer-first – We listen, we help, and we follow through.</li>
                        <li>Sustainability – We choose energy-saving models and ship responsibly.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    We're not just here to sell fans. We want to be the name you trust for ventilation, at home or at
                    work.

            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header">What Makes Us Different</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">We're not a big-box store. We don't sell phones, blenders or
                    microwaves.<br><br>
                    We sell fans. That's it. And that focus makes all the difference.<br><br>
                    Big retailers offer lots of products but not much knowledge. We do the opposite. At ProFans, every
                    fan is chosen for how well it works, how long it lasts and how good it looks. We actually know
                    the details.<br><br>
                    What sets us apart?<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Deep knowledge – Every product is checked by our team.</li>
                        <li>Real support – You get answers from people, not scripts.</li>
                        <li>No drop-shipping – We handle and ship everything ourselves.</li>
                        <li>Honest info – Clear specs, real comparisons and straightforward advice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    For us, this isn't a side business. It's what we do.

            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header">Behind the Scenes</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">What you see in our store is just the tip of the iceberg.<br><br>
                    We start by testing fans for airflow, noise, energy use and build quality. Then we try them out in
                    real life. If a fan doesn't meet our standards, we don't sell it.<br><br>
                    We also take pride in fast, careful shipping. Orders are packed at our own facility to avoid damage
                    and delays. And if something goes wrong, we don't hide behind ticket systems - we fix it.<br><br>
                    We believe in doing things right, from our suppliers to our packaging, because details matter.

                <div class="accordion-header">Why We're the Best</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">"Best" is a big claim and we don't use it lightly.<br><br>
                    We believe ProFans offers the best online experience for buying fans because we built our business
                    with care and focus.<br><br>
                    We're specialists, not generalists.<br><br>
                    We carry fewer products, but better ones.<br><br>
                    We offer support you can count on.<br><br>
                    We ship faster and more reliably than drop-shippers.<br><br>
                    We're not the cheapest and that's okay. We're here for people who want the right product the first
                    time and a team they can trust.

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <div class="main-text">
            <p>OnlyFans was founded with a clear and simple purpose:
                To provide high-quality ventilation products without the noise — both literally and
                figuratively.<br><br>
                In 2020, we noticed a gap in the market. While general electronics retailers carried fans, they were
                often treated as an afterthought: limited selection, questionable build quality, and little product
                expertise. That’s when we decided to create a focused, reliable alternative.<br><br>
                At OnlyFans, we specialize — and we believe there’s strength in that.
                By concentrating solely on fans, we’re able to offer a carefully curated range of products, backed
                by industry knowledge and real customer support.<br><br>
                We serve both residential and commercial clients who value comfort, efficiency, and long-term
                reliability. Whether it’s a whisper-quiet desk fan for your home office or a high-performance ceiling
                fan for
                larger spaces, we make it easier to find the right fit — and deliver it fast.<br><br>
                Our team combines product engineers, customer service professionals, and logistics experts, all
                aligned around one goal:<br>
                Better air, made simple.<br><br>
                <i>We don’t just sell fans. We stand behind them!</i>
        </div>

        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header"> Mission & Values</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">At OnlyFans, we believe comfort should be effortless.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our mission is to make climate control simple, effective, and accessible — without compromising
                    on
                    quality,
                    design, or support. We focus entirely on fans, because we believe in doing one thing
                    exceptionally
                    well.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our values guide every decision we make:<br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliability – We stock only tested, high-performance products built to last.</li>
                        <li>Clarity – No confusing jargon, no upselling — just honest guidance.</li>
                        <li>Customer-first thinking – We listen, we support, and we follow through.</li>
                        <li>Sustainability – We prioritize energy-efficient models and responsible logistics.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Our goal isn’t just to sell fans. It’s to be the most trusted name in residential and commercial
                    ventilation.

                <div class="accordion-header">What Makes Us Different</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">We’re not a generic tech warehouse. We don’t sell phones, blenders, or
                    microwaves.<br><br>
                    We sell fans. That’s it — and that focus makes all the difference.<br>
                    <br>
                    While larger retailers offer broad selection with minimal product knowledge, we do the opposite.
                    At
                    OnlyFans, we offer a refined range of fan models chosen for performance, durability, and design
                    — and we actually know how they work.<br>
                    <br>
                    Here’s what sets us apart:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Narrow focus, deep knowledge – Every product is vetted by our team.</li>
                        <li>Real support – Questions are answered by specialists, not scripts.</li>
                        <li>No drop-shipping – Our inventory is stored, handled, and shipped directly by us.</li>
                        <li>Transparent information – Accurate specs, honest comparisons, and clear use cases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    This isn’t a side category for us. This is the business.

            <div class="accordion-item">
                <div class="accordion-header">Behind the Scenes</div>
                <div class="accordion-content">What you see in the store is the result of a lot that happens behind
                    the scenes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our selection process starts with technical benchmarks — airflow performance, decibel levels,
                    energy use, build quality — and ends with hands-on testing in real-world conditions. If it doesn’t
                    meet our
                    standards, we don’t sell it.<br>
                    <br>
                    We also take pride in fast, careful fulfillment. Orders are packed at our own facility to reduce
                    damage, delays, and surprises. And when something goes wrong, we don’t hide behind ticket systems or
                    long response times — we solve it.<br>
                    <br>
                    We invest in doing things properly — from supplier partnerships to packaging design — because
                    details matter.

                <div class="accordion-content">“Best” is a big word. We don’t use it lightly.<br>
                    <br>
                    At OnlyFans, we believe we offer the best online shopping experience for ventilation products
                    because we’ve built the business with focus and intent.<br>
                    <br>
                    We’re experts, not generalists.<br>
                    <br>
                    We carry fewer products, but better ones.<br>
                    <br>
                    We offer support you can actually rely on.<br>
                    <br>
                    We ship faster and more consistently than drop-ship competitors.<br>
                    <br>
                    We're not the cheapest, and we don’t try to be.<br>
                    We're here for customers who want the right product the first time, and a team they can trust
                    behind
                    it.
